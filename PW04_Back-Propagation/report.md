# Exercise 3 Train FashionMNIST

We will run two experiments:

Shallow Network : Single hidden layer layer with 150 units

Deeper Network : Three hidden layers with 250, 150, 50 hidden layers.

> What are suitable learning rates, batch sizes, number of epochs ? Describe your findings including the achieved test error rates and the learning curves.
